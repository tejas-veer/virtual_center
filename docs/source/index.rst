Abstract:
_________
This survey focuses on the current problems in Earth systems science where machine learning 
algorithms can be applied. It provides an overview of previous work, ongoing work at the Ministry 
of Earth Sciences, Gov. of India, and future applications of ML algorithms to some significant 
earth science problems. We provide a comparison of previous work with this survey, a mind map 
of multidimensional areas related to machine learning and a Gartner’s hype cycle for machine 
learning in Earth system science (ESS). We mainly focus on the critical components in Earth 
Sciences, including atmospheric, Ocean, Seismology, and biosphere, and cover AI/ML 
applications to statistical downscaling and forecasting problems. 

**Keywords**: Machine learning, Mind map, AI/ML applications in Earth Science. Gartner hype curve
